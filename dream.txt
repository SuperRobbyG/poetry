A Dream within a dream
Edgar Allen Poe

Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now
Thus much left me avow
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream:
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night or in a day,
In a vision or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem 
Is but a dream within a dream

I stand amid the roar
of a surf-tormented shore
And I hold within my hand
grains of the golden sand
How few yet how they creep
through my fingers to the deep
While I weep, while I weep
O God, can I not save
one from the pitiless wave
Is all that we see or seem is
But a dream within a dream
